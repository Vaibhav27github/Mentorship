# Employee Performance Prediction – Mentorship Project

## Project Overview

This mentorship project focuses on building machine learning models to predict **employee performance and promotion outcomes** using historical employee data.  
The project follows a structured workflow starting from **data analysis and visualization** to **model building, scaling, and comparison**.

The objective is to use past employee performance data to support **data-driven HR decision-making**.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into three major components:

---

## 1. Employee Data Analysis

**Repository Name:** `Employee Data Analysis`

### Objective
To analyze historical employee data and identify patterns and trends that influence employee performance.

### Work Done
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Handling missing values and outliers  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visual analysis of employee performance metrics  
- Department-wise and experience-wise performance insights  

### Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

### Outcome
Gained meaningful insights into employee performance behavior and identified key features for model development.

## 2. Binary Classification Model Comparison with Scaling

**Repository Name:** `Binary_Classification_Model_Comparison_with_Scaling`

### Objective
To build and compare multiple binary classification models and evaluate the impact of feature scaling on performance.

### Work Done
- Feature selection  
- Train-test split  
- Feature scaling using:
  - StandardScaler  
  - MinMaxScaler  
- Training and evaluation of multiple classification models  

### Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  

### Outcome
Compared different models and analyzed how scaling improves or impacts model performance.

## 3. Employee Promotion Model Comparison

**Repository Name:** `Employee_Promotion_Model_Comparison`

### Objective
To predict whether an employee is likely to be promoted based on historical performance and employee attributes.

### Work Done
- Binary classification for promotion prediction  
- Handling class imbalance  
- Model comparison and evaluation  
- Business-oriented interpretation of results  

### Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  
- XGBoost (if applicable)  

### Outcome
Developed a reliable prediction model to assist HR teams in promotion-related decisions.
